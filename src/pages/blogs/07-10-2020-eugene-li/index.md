## Way to The Airport


It has already been several months since the outbreak of the notorious virus COVID-19. As the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in California continued to climb, I decided to go back to my home Taiwan on 5/2. It was an unforgettable day for me, not only because of the joy of returning home but also the experience I learned from this trip.


I got up early that morning to prepare every item I would need for this trip, 75% ethanol, N95 surgical masks, thick lab goggles, and a pair of gloves. Everything was checked carefully like a soldier preparing his sword and shield for his last battle. When I finally finished all this work, it was already around 4 pm, time for me to go to LAX airport. My friend Kevin came to pick me up. I walked out of my home the first time since the end of March. As soon as I opened the door, I felt so unreal when observing things around me. The sun seemed so bright like a gigantic phoenix chasing me down, and the singing of birds was so harmonious that I just wanted to listen to this beautiful melody and take a nap right away. Although it was the same view that I saw for the entire two years, I never felt this way before. To me, the sun was just the sun, and birds were just birds, but at that moment, I felt like nature was telling me a story of herself.


Soon, Kevin and I began our ride to LAX. The atmosphere in the car showed a sharp contrast with the outside world. While we were excitedly discussing what we’re going to do when we get back, the outside world remained completely silent. From Isla Vista to the highway, we saw no more than twenty people outside, reminding me of the scene in Avengers Infinity War when Thanos eliminated half of people and made Earth a dark and lifeless wild land. If it were to be before the pandemic, there would definitely be a bunch of people outside playing sports or jogging to party. Kevin and I expected this was just for IV since many people had gone home already, and there are not many people staying here. Surprisingly, this phenomenon continued even until we got to Los Angeles. We drove past downtown LA as easy as crossing the road in the morning, and it was the first time we got to LAX without traffic jams. LAX was known to be one of the most crowded places in Los Angeles, but that day, the airport was just bare and empty. 

##At the Airport


Kevin and I got to the airport two hours early, so we decided to rest on the bench next to the front door. While we were resting, we found the atmosphere at the airport was just weird. Some people were wearing goggles that are for hazardous lab work, some people were wearing a respirator that we had only seen in war movies, and some were even wearing protective suits like they were going to cook meth with Heisenberg from breaking bad. However, all of them were doing the same thing. They were all looking at the big screen on the top of their head. We followed their sincere eyes and looked up at the giant screen too, and we found out an even more unbelievable fact. We saw that more than seventy percent of flights had been canceled, and people around us were all praying that the next one won’t be our flight. 


Just by standing there for five minutes, Kevin and I were hardly affected by this gloomy atmosphere. We are so nervous that we even forgot to breathe and ignored that pungent alcohol smell. Luckily, after an hour of waiting, our flight to Taiwan was confirmed that it wouldn’t be canceled. Everyone’s nerve tension was finally relaxed. Although people still remained silenced, we could all sense that everything was on the right track, and we’re about to go home.

## On the Plane


Everything went well as we entered the plane and we all got home safely. Nevertheless, that was just my imagination, if that’s the case, 5/2 wouldn’t be an important day that I would remember for the rest of my life. Just two hours after departure, I heard that there were some snoring sounds two rows away from me. I tried to ignore that sound and listened to the music, but that annoying sound didn’t seem to stop. Therefore, I took off my AirPods and turned my head back to where the noise came from. I saw a man coughing sharply like he was about to cough his lungs out, and two flight attendants were around him discussing what to do. That was one of the most horrifying moments in my life. Everyone was shocked by him and didn’t know what to react to. I quickly imagined some scenarios where I got infected by COVID-19 and coughing till dead, but talking about horrifying, I believe my fear couldn’t compare to the girl sitting next to that coughing guy. She was undoubtedly the most desperate person on that plane. I could hear her crying from my seat even when I had my music at maximum sound, but there’s nothing I could do.


People, including me, seated next to the men urgently asked for changing seats. However, our requests were rejected because there weren’t enough seats for us to keep social distancing and that they were afraid that changing positions might cause the virus to spread, which is reasonable to me. However, what was more irritating to me is that the man knew he was coughing before he got on the plane and still decided to take the flight. Even though we all have our surgical masks on, I could see it from everyone else’s eyes that we all hate the guy for making such an irresponsible move. Still, none of us spoke a single word because we’re afraid that as soon as we opened our mouth, the deadly virus would dive into our body from nowhere. The good news is that after the flight attendants had discussed with the coughing man, he was told to move to an isolated room by himself.


## Conclusion


The rest of the flight went pretty peaceful with silence. All of us wanted a comfortable nap after experiencing that horrifying moment, and after 12 hours of flying, we soon arrived at Taiwan international airport safely. I could finally see the smile from everyone’s face. We all knew we’re finally back home. **This experience taught me two valuable lessons**. If there were no COVID-19, I might never realize these two crucial life lessons. The first is to observe every minor detail around us with gratitude because even the simplest thing that is normal to us could be taken away at any moment, so we must cherish everything we have right now. The second lesson I learned is that while we’re pursuing our goals, we should make sure we don’t bring troubles to others. Sometimes, our small careless mistakes could bring substantial adverse effects that we could never think of. Just like what Jane E. Brody states in her article[Source][1], “If we want to be a stronger, more resilient society, we have to focus on rebuilding foundations centered around people.” With a little more caring about others and the environment around us, the world will become a better place.
