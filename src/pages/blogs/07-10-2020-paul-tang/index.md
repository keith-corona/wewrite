When the wind began to growl, raindrops ruthlessly slammed on my face and pierced my soul. Hiding under a roof, me and my roommate, Max, leaned against the shopping cart full of groceries. Eggs, pork, snacks, water, and all kinds of food all scrambled together and rested in the cart waiting to be stocked in a refrigerator. It was Several minutes ago, as we stepped out of Albertson, dark clouds masked the lazy afternoon sun followed suddenly by rain. Behind us, it was Albertson. In front us, it was the way home.


“What is he doing?” As I asked Max, he was texting to one of our roommates who should give us a ride home. “I will never do that arm workout again. Not in a rainy day”


“Me neither, but he is not responding.” Max huffed, still texting restlessly on his phone. Last time when we went to Costco, we carried all the stuff back home with our bare hands. It was a terrible memory. My arms were nearly wasted, and I could not play video games for two days. The sound of the storm rubbed my heartstring; meanwhile, I stared at the screen. The wind was violent. The world was silent. 


“**He is not picking us up. We are going home by ourselves.**” Max broke the silence, and the news broke my heart.


The groceries filled the cart like rice and beans exploded burritos. Some people ran into their cars, while some others stood by waiting to be picked up by their loved ones. Nevertheless, we were like merely pigs waiting to be gassed or shot due to COVID-19, nothing to do and nowhere to go (Corkery, The New York Times) No uber car or any other public transportation was one of the doctrines that we made between our housemates at the beginning of the quarantine. The rain did not give us any break; every moment we wasted on wondering for nothing, the rain was getting heavier.


“Shall we?” Max carried up a whole bag of groceries and spoke, “there is a great burden on us, but we keep going.”
He did make a good speech, but I was too desperate for his inspirational words. I said “Are you mad? We will be able to carry these things if we have a Hulk.”


Max laughed, but he did not stop packing up groceries. His eyes shifted across the street and mirrored his thought: he was definitely going to carry the groceries back under this downpour. He said, “Paul, is Lothric Knight your online username? I thought a knight would never flinch in the face of difficulty.”


It seemed that there was no retreat for us, and I mumbled, “**we are doomed today.**”

I carried 2 packs of eggs with my left arm, and my left hands were holding a bag of vegetables, which was considerably lighter than the rest of the groceries. Another hand of mine was carrying two big water bottles with my fingers while a bag of snacks hanged on my arm. I was fully armed. I felt like I was wearing a spacesuit, and every small step was laborious. These were all I could take. Our house was about a mile apart. As the first step out of the shelter, it began to rain cats and dogs. To add insult to injury, the rain was heavy, and the groceries were heavier. The hardships came upon us, but there was no way back because we had made our first step.


Only 100 meters away from the store, my arms began to sour, and my fingers began to hurt. The rain was striking my face while the plastic bags were cutting my fingers. I wonder if I was holding knives since it hurt so much. Besides the pain, water bottles became more and more slippery as rain drops fell on my sweating hands. However, the only thing I worried about were the gems that I carried with my left arm; the rain drenched the cardboard box, and the eggs were on the edge of falling apart. The thing that I feared most was watching these eggs crack onto the ground, and days of breakfast would be gone, so I held eggs like a mother dog carrying her puppy. I desperately wanted to teleport back home, but the only thing I could do was move on.


There was 50 meters left till a cross road where we could take a break. “Paul, how is the workout?” Max asked me, walking straight ahead. On his forearm, every blood vein beneath the tanned skin was on the brink of burst. “Two of us actually have the strength of Hulk.”


“**I am fine,**” I replied in a weak voice. “**Really.**”


I was exalted. Every string of the fibers on my muscle were stretched to reach their limits and begging me to give up. My shoes were drenched in water, and my white shirt was wet through. I walked like Sisyphus, holding the groceries like pushing the giant stone, having no hope and idea where my tragedy would finally come to an end. There was no one else except us walking under this downpour; the busy marketplace had become a forgotten city only goner like us would pass by. I want to give up. However, when cold wind rushed through my face, it blew off any fatigue within me like tears in the rain, and whispered to me in her charming voice telling me to keep going. As the pain went harder, I could not help starting to sing an old song: “He said the pain is a mere flea bite in this world. wipe tears, don't ask why” (Zheng, [Sailor][1]). **On the empty street, the clouds were howling; rain was roaring; and we were singing.**


We continued our way home when we passed through the cross road. It was the gym that I had not been to since February. Ever since, the only workout I did was several sets of push-ups a day. However, today was quite a workout. My arms were sending me signals that they were lifting the weight far beyond my limits. Although it was painful, I was glad that I finally did some workout outside of my small bedroom. Just like Sophia Dembling mentioned in her article that people should keep exercising and getting out of the house and take a walk under quarantine. It reminded me of the old days when I ran track in my high school. It was the same with a 400 meters dash. When I was still in Albertson, I could feel the same fear, excitement, and determination that I had on the starting line of the track field. I knew that 400-meters was going to be really tough. In the last 100 meters, **every breath I took was like thousands of needles went through my throat, and every step forward was tearing my legs apart.** I know the bitterness would come, but once I was on the starting line, the only choice for me was to run. 


“Max, give me a moment.” The water bottle became very slippery and fell onto the ground as I shouted out to Max, “I need to take a break!”


Max put down the groceries for a moment and briefly stretched his arms. “We were only a block away from our house. I can hear that warm bath is calling us.” 


“I thought we were in the shower already,” I replied. The rain slammed my face heartlessly, felt like taking a cold spring shower. Indeed, we were not far from home. **The rain wetted our cloth but not our hearts.** The only choice for us was going forward. I carried up the groceries and was ready for a final sprint although I could barely feel my fingers. 


I dragged my legs every step toward our house while my unconscious hands had their fingers to be feezed in a pose to hook the groceries bags. Every cell inside me was crying out loud exhausted. But every feeling had faded away once we saw the door of home.


We arrived home with all the groceries remaining intact. We did what I thought to be impossible. I looked at my arms. They were still there. My body was in a state of collapse, but my spirit has been ignited. Difficulties might come, but we bit the bullet and kept going. Feeling this little pain in the rain and the beating of my heart, I spoke, “it was really a good workout.”


In the days of COVID-19, there would be a lot more difficulties confronting us. However, whatever it comes, we will face it and make it through. People are born with a warrior heart. **The world is painful, and this painful world breaks our bones but never touches the noble soul beneath our heart. The world is dim and dark, and it is the unbreakable soul that lead us to the distant light.** (word count: 1499)
