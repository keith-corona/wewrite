##Phone Call

It was May 10th, at one o’clock in the morning. I was wide awake, feeling the temperature kept getting lower and lower in loud silence. The wind was howling and trying to break into my room from the windows like a madman pounding on the door. I stared at nothing in the darkness, heard the trees struggling and trying to survive this night. I wrapped myself up with my quilt to block the cry for help from the trees and windows so that I would not feel pity for them. My mind was filled with tangled thoughts and the phonecall I made with my mom that night -- the phonecall which broke my dreams and took away all of what I was hoping for. Earlier that night, I had a phone call with my mom as usual. After my mom made sure that I am doing well, she said quietly: “Your flight has been canceled.” Something collapsed in my mind, I felt so **helpless** at that time, and I realized how **powerless** individuals are when facing diseases, natural disasters, or national and international policy.

##COVID-19

At the end of 2019, a new type of pneumonia called **Coronavirus Disease 2019** appeared and started to spread internationally within a couple of months. Most of the flights were canceled, social distancing started in many countries, people were isolated to prevent the propagation of the virus. When my college first introduced the decision of transferring to remote learning, most of my friends from China packed up their luggage immediately and went back home before the flights were canceled. I booked my flight in early November before the virus erupted, so my flight was originally planned for June. I had no idea how the situation would go in the following months, I did not want to waste the money for my light so I bet on luck, but Tyche was not on my side this time.

I seem to have a stronger desire to go back home than most of my friends and most people around me. I have been in America for four years, the only chance I can go back home is during the summer holidays. During the past summer holidays, I had been taking classes in other cities and could only stay at home for at most two weeks. For four years, I spent about six weeks with my family in total; for the rest of the time I had been taking classes in other cities by myself or I was in America by myself. Even though I have been in America for four years, I still feel like I am a stranger and I do not belong here. I do have friends, I do have places to live, I do have work to do, but it still does not feel like home. Every time I board the plane to America, I start to count down the days of going back home on the flight. Summer holidays are like Christmas to me, now Christmas is gone. 

##Kitchen Chat

With all these disturbing thoughts, I could not fall asleep. Since I  moved into a small apartment with two other girls, we have spent most of the time working on improving our meals. I did not want to stay in that depressed mood, I felt like doing something to divert my attention, so I got up and went to the kitchen to season some ribs for lunch and dinner. A few minutes after I got into the kitchen, I heard a gentle voice with a little surprise: “Ah! You are still awake too!” One of my roommates came into the kitchen with tousled hair and loose-fitting pajamas. Her face looked tired but not sleepy under the dim kitchen light. The air seemed to be lighter with a company in the kitchen at one o’clock in the morning. Not long after, the other one came out too. We stared at each other for a second and started laughing. None of us expected to meet each other at this time, especially when the kitchen became our favorite place to go to.  Then we chatted about food, weather, school work, and our annoying neighbors who always party with loud music from midnight to early in the morning. Fifteen minutes later, I went back to my room and felt a lot better even though that was only a fifteen-minute talk. It suddenly reminds me of the similar experience Sophia Dembling shared in her article [“Introverts, Extroverts, and Social Distancing,”][1] contacting others can greatly reduce our stress(Dembling). I never knew if my roommates came out because they felt stressed too or they were just hungry, but I really appreciate the chat we had in the kitchen at one o’clock in the morning. 

Dembling also mentions making phone calls to friends who we have not met for a long time and catching up with their lives. That night, I had a dream of my family and my cousin giving me a hug. I woke up with tears and decided to make a call to my cousin. He asked me about my life under social distancing and said he got a new job. I sent him some pictures of the meals we made and talked about some random topics. He never asked me why I suddenly decided to give him a call, but I think he knew I was not feeling good because for the following two days, he kept sending me messages, keeping up with me, and making sure that I am okay. Now we randomly send each other messages almost every day, we do not even answer each other right away, but it is really helpful for me to combat the stress. Jane E. Brody says in her article [“Take Steps to Counter the Loneliness of Social Distancing,”][2] “It’s not about finding more time, it’s about making the time we have available better quality.” Sometimes the things we do are not always meaningful and we do not need to spend hours focusing on something as long as they are helping us and making us better. “Wasting” some time helps us relax our brains and lose the string. The conversation I had with my roommates does not need to be inspirational, shooting a text message to my family does not even take thirty seconds, seasoning ribs at one o’clock in the morning does not need to have a purpose except for having a better meal, but these “meaningless” and “useless” things helped me find my lighthouse when I lost my direction.

##Beach Walk 

I think my roommates realized there was something not quite right with me from the one-o’clock talk because the next day after dinner, they pushed me out of the door for a walk. I never had the habit of taking a walk after dinner and they knew it, but they did not listen that evening. They just pushed me out and took me to the beach. The sun was setting when we were walking on the beach, the temperature was not as cold as that thought. I felt sands flowing between my toes, I heard the low growl from the ocean, I smelled the disgusting fishy odor from the dead sea plants. The wind ran by me, gave me a chill, and ran away happily; like a little boy successfully did a trick and giggled for cheer. The little waves on the beach ran after each other and told whispers like teenage girls telling their friends about their lovers. The sunset was like the fire that burned down a large area of Santa Barbara in November. We took some silly pictures and I sent them to my mom. “It is so nice to see that you girls are doing good,” my mom said, “I was worrying if you would get depressed of staying indoors all the time and not being able to come home.” I held my tears until I hung up the video chat with my mom. When I was feeling depressed, there were many people caring about me, trying to make me feel better, and helping me combat the darkness. I made them worry about me without even realizing as I was stuck in my own little world, focused too much on my own emotions, and could not notice the feeling of my loved ones. They are always there for me because I can not make it without them.

##We Will Do It Together 

When I recall these events and some small details I did not notice at that time, I realize people seem to be more sensitive about the emotions and psychological situations of other people during this hard time. We experienced depression and we know how dreadful it is, so we can easily notice when other people are having the same feeling. We have experienced the same depression, we have the same feeling, we are on the same path, so we have sympathy. Although we are isolated farther away by the virus, our hearts are staying closer together. I feel so lucky to have these two girls as my roommate, I really appreciate their help. The virus and social distancing are not as scary because we have each other.
