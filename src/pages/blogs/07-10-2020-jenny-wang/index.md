## Welcome, Everybody! 

“OW!” A scream breaks out the tranquility of the night. The oil splashes from my pan, as if thousands of marbles bounds upward from the ground at the same time. If you listen carefully and take a closer look, you will hear the beef threshes in the gravy; you will see potatoes sink into the brownish spice; you will observe how the holes are emerging from the bottom of the soup, signaling the ready of a supper. Everything in this picture seems to compose a live choral symphony. Welcome to the **live channel** of Jenny’s kitchen! 


## What My Life Looks Like 

This is Jenny, a UCSB freshman who currently lives in Isla Vista. I used to live the normal life of a college student, but something has been changed now. Due to the spread of _Covid-19_, the US government has enacted policies to limit the contact between people; dining halls and restaurants are forced to close. As a college student who never cooks at home, I have to cook meals for myself now, and the live channel of Jenny’s kitchen begins to set up. Having encountered many unexpected situations, it gradually comes to the point that I realize the necessity of mastering basic life skills. More importantly, this unique experience in the kitchen has taught me that we always have to adjust ourselves to adapt to changes in our life with a **positive attitude**. 


## Preparations: Grocery Shopping 

My live channel in the kitchen is made up of many **snapshots**. Through its lens, the first image appears under the dazzling sun with a sweat smell. The afternoon of Apr 2 was bright and boiling, with the sultry air of a muggy season; the cars were honking harshly and the people inside were waiting impatiently. We were at Camino Real Marketplace, the area where all large grocery stores are in Santa Barbara. To reduce the number of times I get out to the greatest extent, Zhao and I came here once a month to buy basic supplies. We were like vampires being exposed in daylight, fully covered in our clothes, masks, gloves, and hats, but so conscious to keep distances with others all the time as if heading to a _battlefield_; in fact, all human beings were standing at the same front line to fight against the virus. However, this was also the time when logistic supplies on our sides are in a shortage. Many basic essentials were out of stocks: eggs, milk, rice, toilet paper… It was harder to find pork than other meat due to Coronavirus: a 50% cut down in the production of pork nationwide had raised the price of pork loin from $2 to $3 per pound in Costco ([Reiley, Washington Post][1]). Zhao and I carefully selected every possible ingredient and spice, comparing their prices as _quickly_ as possible. But the _battle_ was not ended: on the way to move every item from the cart to the Uber, from the gate of our apartment to the second floor, I gazed at Zhao’s face—her cheeks tightened, month clenched firmly, her eyes glancing unwavering at the front. Our feet were dragged heavily on the ground as if filled with lead. Another nightmare began after arriving home: the space in refrigerators seemed never enough to fill up with our appetites. The _soldiers_ strained every muscle to squash the loots into their own place to win the last phase of the first round. 


## OH NO! I don’t want this!

The lens of the channel then turned to the next episode, it was less intense but more **tedious**. In the picture, I was stretching out my body on the sofa and yawning with my dull and lifeless eyes, like a salted fish. No more skillful procedures were required than adding some water and putting fast-frozen food into the microwave to get them ready, even a machine could complete these actions properly with fuel. _Frustration, anxiety, and depression_ flooded my mind; apparently, I was suffering from psychological distress during the quarantine ([Brooks et al][2]). I knew, it was the time to find my **normal routine**, starting from taking every meal seriously. 


## Here Is My Showtime! 

“OK… Hmm...I got the oil..Yes, the garlic...What’s next?” The next episode of my kitchen channel took its shot with more **dirty handwork**. This was where the show really got started; the new life experience was launched through the aroma of fried eggs in the morning, the suffocating smoke at noon, and the moment when the first dip of soup touched my tongue in the evening. The stars blinked. A pleasant odor rose, sneaking through the alley. The room was dark and quiet. I opened the wok excitingly. This was the **first time** I made braised beef with potatoes. It did not seem that hard to turn on the gas stove, heat the wok, and pour oil. The slimy texture of pickled beef made it skidded through my fingers like an elegant skater. Putting it into the wok, the beef turned into a dancer, spinning on the oil with cheerful steps. Minutes later, he invited Lady Potato to join the floor. Their steps brought them together, as the atmosphere heated. Mr. Beef reddened his face while Lady Potato burnt her smooth and creamy skin. The chilis, salt, sugar, and soy sauce became the best flavors between the couple in this melancholy night. They would always be together but be devoured eventually. What a pity to end their dance. Looking at them through heaven’s view, I stir-fried them constantly with a spatula until the sizzling oil whistled the horn of my _victory_: that night, I was an _honorable soldier_ standing on the podium for my triumph; the sense of pride remained in my heart and encouraged me to explore the unknown. Later, I became a player on “Lazycook”, the phone app for cooking instructions, attempting to unlock more and more advanced levels with endless curiosity and passion, no matter how complex the steps seemed to be. As I learnt the techniques to fry, steam, and boil, I started to _relished_ the time on the gas stove and built my **confidence** through the “experiments”. In my channel, I was producing artworks; I realized that the delicacy in my life could only be created by my hands. 


## OOPS…

Meanwhile, Jenny’s kitchen channel was full of **accidents**. Nothing could stop situations of hurry-scurry: sometimes eggshells fell into the pan with an unlucky crack; sometimes there was too much oil, too much salt, and too many peppers; sometimes the food was overcooked with a burnt smell filling up every corner of the room; sometimes the hot oil splatters without any control. However, no matter how unpalatable the food turned out to be, I had to eat it or try another time. My mood swung and my hand shook unconsciously when being afraid of controlling an accurate amount of spice. In this lens, cooking was similar to taking a test: I had to be very **careful** that every little mistake could ruin the final result. 


## Jenny’s Wonderland 

Later, more possibilities have been switched on in the kitchen channel since I bought a new oven. As the only way to serve my sweet tooth, I turned the direction of my _battlefield_ to this novel machine. Soon, a refined lady raised her curtain every morning with cheese bread and brewed tea. After melting cheddar cheese, butter, whipped cream, and milk, and pouring the mixture to the bread, she only needed to wait for 15 minutes to savor her treat. Once, she entered the micro-world in the oven and became the five-year-old girl who she once was, gazing firmly into the fluffy surface out of an adorable scent. In this wonderland, heat pushed the substances to ferment as if a gigantic balloon inflated. A net slowly covered the pores of this kingdom. Time froze, and I lost, but that feeling of **joy** remained. I noticed how **ecstasy** to embellish a girl’s _sweet dream_ every morning! 


## My Gains 

Some say variety is the spice of life. In the bonus scenes of the channel, the college girl enjoys comparing the prices of food, making plans to balance the nutrients, and enriching basic life experience. During this special time of Covid-19, she finds herself more positive and energetic as she takes her meals regularly. Cooking is not only a tool to satisfy her taste bud; indeed, it becomes a **self-pilgrimage**. Jenny’s kitchen is always creating possibilities despite obstacles on her road and the helpless feeling to approach the unknown. Yet, it is important to recognize that whenever and wherever you are, keeping a **healthy lifestyle** is crucial to maintain a good life. If possible, always feed yourself well so that you have the energy to fight for the future!
