As humans, we make decisions every minute that not only affect us personally but also the people around us. I don't precisely know when COVID-19 started, but I know this pandemic started long before I knew about it. It was difficult to be informed about the spread of the pandemic in the world because I was in college striving to major in Biology. I found out about the pandemic like in early January when it was approaching neighbor nations and that at any moment it was going to settle in the United States.

##Everything change in the Blink of an Eye

When I found out about the pandemic I didn't really understand the gravity of the problem and how serious it was, but everything altered when I received the email from Henry T. Yang announcing that the winter quarter had to be canceled to prevent the spread of the disease in our whole country. After reading the email everything changed my plans to go home for spring break, my plans to study for my final exams, and my work.

##There is Always something that Holds us Back

When Yang sent the first email, I was in my room with my roommate and after a few hours, we both received emails from all our teachers, announcing their plan modifications for the final exams. Of the four teachers I had, three of them decided that the tests were to be taken online. However, my chemistry teacher was the only one who said that the plans were still going as intended because the chemistry department hadn’t said anything about the situation.

During this situation **what my heart desired the most was being home** with my family, but what my mind desired the most is to stay and strive for a good grade. But what worried me the most was that if I became infected I would also infect my family. Overcoming my fears, I decided to stay until I took that chemistry test. It was my second time taking that class the first time I failed and felt ineffective, but this time I wanted to pass that class and prove what I was capable to do.

##Everything was getting worst

We decided to lock ourselves in our room, during the day we studied and at night we watched a movie. Although it was difficult because every hour that passed the residential hall seemed like a tank of water with significant holes in which the water escaped driving students to their homes, everyone was returning to their safe homes with their families. The seconds turned into minutes and the minutes into hours, and at the same time, I wanted to go home. Only a few students who wanted to take the exam and the other who wanted to party remained in the hall. The location of my room on the fourth floor was the worst because all the students were loud and everything got worse the second night. On the second night, they started **throwing parties**; apparently, they didn't care about the gravity of the situation.

##UCSB gets Closed Absolutely

Everything changed on Saturday when we received another email from Yang saying that absolutely everything was canceled, regardless of what the course departments say. Also, we received an email that we could vacate the hall if we wanted and return until fall. Unfortunately, those emails came very late, like at six in the afternoon so our parents couldn't come for us so late at night. I immediately called my parents to tell them about the news, but my dad couldn't pick me up the next morning because he had to work. I found myself in the need to ask for help from my roommate's family, to see if they could pick me up too. I remember that night we didn't sleep because we started to pack everything and we were talking about how our first year of college changed so suddenly. We also talked about how we met, of the nonsense, we did together, and how we practically became friends. My roommate's parents arrived at around eight in the morning in Santa Barbara, and we were ready out there waiting for them with all the suitcases. We arrived at about ten in the morning in Los Angeles. 

##What I take from it

Many of us live every day with the certainty that there will be more days and as if the goals we set for ourselves are going to be 100% accomplished. This is not the case, thanks to COVID-19 I learned that life can change in the blink of an eye. Although we have so many things to do, we always have to inform ourselves about the circumstances of our world and try to take every decision with wisdom. Despite how I finished my first year of college I also enjoyed it attaining new experiences. I met many people from different nationalities and made numerous friends.
