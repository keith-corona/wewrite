##“Congrats, you can go home now.”

Staring at the phone, I subconsciously lifted the corner of my mouth and smiled. However, I did not feel joy inside of my heart knowing how much I paid for this ticket. As an international student, I have been traveling between China and the U.S. twice a year for 6 years. I am like an experienced mariner who always knows when, where, and how to sail to the destination. Nonetheless, this time I can’t find a way home. An epidemic caused by the coronavirus appeared in mainland China in January 2020, without any vaccine formulated for this virus, things go out of control. After the first case of coronavirus in the U.S. was reported in the end of January in Washington state, the outbreak started. I can still recall how the crowded cafeteria at school became desolate; I remember the scene where half of the students rushed out of the library when the school announced all the finals are now online; I have seen more and more people wearing masks on the streets…

The most shocking part is that everything happened within three months. For me,  I went from watching the news everyday to keep updated on the new cases of coronavirus to feel totally numb about the numbers I saw. When the number reached 1million, I stopped tracking. 


##I told myself: just be patient, I can go back home. 

In April, I booked my ticket for June13th, which is the next day after my final exams finished. I moved out of my college dorm and rented a room nearby. During those days, I can see the clock of time, tickling away every minute I wasted alone. My life is normal yet unexciting, I only talk to a fixed number of people: my roommate and sometimes the ubereats driver. Everyday, I tried many ways to think positive when I had endless abundant time to spend alone. I compared myself to Thoreau who lived alone next to the Walden Pond; the astronomer who lived in the space station, the billionaire who will be the first to be sent to Mars... But whenever the daydream ends, I can see the invisible clock again, telling me the day is still far ahead. 
**The day will eventually come, and I can go home. **

##  “ Don’t cry honey, you can go home.” My mom said. 

I nodded, with tears running down my face.  I later realized we are on the phone and she can’t see me, so I weeped and replied: “Ok, I will wait.”  My flight got cancelled due to the virus. The[CAAC](https://onemileatatime.com/chinese-airlines-banned-from-flying-to-us/)enacted limited air routes, and my flight was not preserved. The balloon filled with anxiety and frustration in my heart finally exploded. I can’t stop crying, trying to let out all the negative feelings that I held in. “There will be other ways.” I remembered my mom repeated this many times to me, even though both of us know that the nonstop tickets between China and America have been sold out three weeks ago. Finally, she consoled me that I can fly to a third country and transfer from there to home, and she knows someone who is selling these tickets. “All you are going to do is to pack up your suitcase and wait,” my mom said in a lighter tone, “ I might see you at home the next day.” 
My mom is right. I got the ticket in three hours. More surprisingly, the plane will depart in 8 hours.I felt unreal on the way to the airport. How come the astronomer fixed his rocket ship and is ready to leave so quickly?  What should I say when I see my parents at home? Will the food on the airplane be good? These random thoughts crackled in my head, telling me how happy I am. 

##This is the most joyful thing in the world---I am coming home. 

The excitement lasted all the way from Los Angeles to Belarus. I was supposed to have a flight connection between the US and China at Minsk, Belarus for 1 hours. However, when I got out of the plane at Belarus, I was sweating because of the protective suit I wore. The stuffy suit is designed to prevent the virus at the airport yet I felt suffocating wearing them. In addition,  I had to run to the boarding gate with this huge suit, like a penguin waddling on the ground.

##The procedure before boarding 
+ check in 
+ security check 
+ put on protective suit 
+ wear safety goggles 
+ change face masks 
+ check body temperature 
+ check body temperature again 
+ boarding 

When I finally  arrived at the gate, the staff approached to check my temperature. During this special time, every passenger needs to have a normal temperature before boarding. However, this time she looked at me, and shook her head slightly, “ Sorry miss Liu, your temperature  is too high to board. You may go home once your physical condition is normal.” I opened my mouth but couldn't mumble a word. Yes, I knew the policy, and I even knew I am healthy. But everything I said seems to be meaningless. 
I waited at the airport till the plane departed. I was surprised I did not cry. Instead, when I stared at the plane which vanished in the clouds. I felt calm but resolute---**I was so close to the destination. I will reach there. **
Finally, the ground staff came back and checked my body temperature. He checked multiple times and it all appeared normal. Later he asked me to do a nucleic acid testing by swabbing my throat. I followed what he said and waited for the results. Sitting in the room alone, I saw a clock showing the current time in Minsk, I think I had waited here for more than 8 hours. However, this was not as frustrating as I thought it would be. After everything I had experienced, I knew the only thing I could do at this point is to feel positive. What can be worse than this? I thought it to myself.  Finally, the staff came back with a smile on his face:
**“You are eligible for our flight. Congrats, you can go home now.” **
